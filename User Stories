Big Board


So what exactly is our project? Are we meeting all 5 criteria?

No, we’re putting sections 2-4 into one section.

Title: User posts to their University Board

Title: Rate my professor (LOW PRIORITY)

Title: Find someone to study, play sports, date with right now (fast)

Title: Find someone to play sports with at a moment’s notice
 they want focus on pickup games/workout buddies not intramurals

Title: Put yourself in a category with other users

Title: User sees what people are saying in their university.

Title: Dating portion (high priority)
Customer goals:
- Similar in design to tinder ex. swipe left/right
         - Make your own profile with picture - should get profile from user input when you first login
            -  Low priority- rating system for the lowest and highest counts
            - necessary to add barebones chat function once people match
