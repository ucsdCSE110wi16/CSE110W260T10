User Stories:

1)
As a student who has a test tomorrow,
I want to find a study buddy near me in order to help me study
So that I can pass the class.

Feature:
The app that the customer wants will have a "Find a study buddy" section where the user will input their location and the app will
show the profiles of people around them who are also looking for a study buddy. Once the user finds a suitable study buddy, they can
then chat and decide on a place and time to meet up to study. This feature will allow people to find one another and meet up to 
study together.

2)
As a UCSD student,
I want to find others around me
So that we can go out on a date.

Feature:
The app will also contain a dating section very similar to Tinder. The customer wants the app to be like Tinder, but for only
UCSD students. In order to log in, the user needs a ucsd email address. This will prevent outsiders and non-students from joining
this university-specific app. The purpose of this section of the app is for users to look at pictures of other students from UCSD
and swipe right or left, depending whether they want to chat and go out on a date with the person or not.

3)
